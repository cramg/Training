# Python: Exercise 1

Make a python script that prints out the list of files and directories found in the working directory in alphabetic order.

## Preparation

- In the directory "foo" you will 6 files.

## Task

Write a python script named "lsord" to do the following:
   - Collect the list of files and directories in the working dir where the script is executed.
   - Print out the sorted list of files and directory names, with a new line per name.


Make the script executable and move it to your Mybin directory.
Execute the "new command 'lsord'" once you are inside "foo".


```bash
cd foo
lsord
```

And the resulting action will produce the following output:

```bash
aaa.txt
bbb.txt
ccc.txt
ddd.txt
eee.txt
fff.txt
```

*Tip: have a look to the native python library "os" to enlist the files and directories.*
